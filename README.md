# MathGame-Unity

Final mini math game
Unity mini game. The goal is to shoot the penguins with the correct answer.
Based on TigerTail foundation provided by Conestoga College VARLab.

I added the gameplay and all the code for that. I expanded all given scripts and created new ones.
The penguins appear and move randomly on the scene, each penguin has a sum.
There are falling snowbals you can pickup and throw. There's one snowbal per sum with the correct result.
The goal is to shoot the penguin with the snowball with the correct result to the sum each penguin has.

You can go to the base camp to retrieve missing snowballs (when you shoot and the snowball rolls to far from you)

The snowballs appear always on a self moving wheelbarrow, if you want to have the snowballs near, you have to travel on the wheelbarrow to the position you like most.

If you hit the correct penguin before the time is up you get 1 point, if you hit an incorrect one the HUD will display which penguin thit you hit wit the wrong answer.

Number of penguins, Time and range for the sum numbers can be controlled in the inspector.
